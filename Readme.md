PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Creating a nodeJS Reminder Application 

- Functionalities of the project 
- As a user, I should be able to see all Reminder items fetched using a REST API (from Assignment 9).
- As a user, I should be able to click a Reminder item and able to see its detailed view.
- As a user, I should be able to open add a new Reminder item view by clicking the add button.
- As a user, I should be able to add a Reminder item by entering the title, detail, and date time.
- As a user, I should be able to close a Reminder item as complete.






REST API

- REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and REST API (Application Programming Interface) is a way of implementing web services in a standard and flexible way that adheres to the principles of REST.

- A REST API is a web-based API that uses HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. to access and manipulate resources that are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers).

Applications to install:
- MongoDB Server
- NodeJS
- MongoDB Compass
- postman


- MongoDB Server 
- MongoDB Server is a popular open-source NoSQL database server that stores data in flexible, document-based structures instead of traditional relational tables. MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data, and it provides a powerful and flexible way to store and manage data in a variety of different formats.

- NodeJS
- Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server-side. It is built on top of the V8 JavaScript engine that powers Google Chrome, and it provides a set of APIs for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications.

- MongoDB Compass 
- MongoDB Compass is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows developers to interact with MongoDB databases. It provides a visual way to explore and manipulate data, making it easier for developers to manage their databases.

- Postman
- MongoDB Server is a popular open-source NoSQL database server that stores data in flexible, document-based structures instead of traditional relational tables. MongoDB is designed to handle large volumes of data, and it provides a powerful and flexible way to store and manage data in a variety of different formats.

How to run on Terminal?

- Type "npm start" in one terminal. This is for frontend.
- Navigate to server folder and type "npm start " to connect to db 


- Installed these dependencies:
   npx create-react-app remainder-app
   npm install --save sass  
   npm install express cors mongoose

- SCSS is used for styling.   

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
